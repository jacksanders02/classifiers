# Classifiers

A repository of basic classifiers from COM2004

## Usage
Ensure that the data txt is formatted like the example dataset (from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine)) with one sample per line, with values separated by commas - no whitespaces.
The classifiers assume that the class labels are at the end of each line, so ensure they are in the expected position else the classifier won't classify anything correctly.


## Current Classifiers
- Bayesian Classifier (bayes.py)
- Perceptron Classifier (PLA.py)
